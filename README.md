# Retr.io Games

Retr.io Games is an arcade room with games including Blackjack and Game of Life. The user is first brought to the home screen where they have the option to sign in or sign up. If the user has not made an account, they sign up with a unique email and password. The user then customizes their display name and their character icon’s shape and color. Emails, passwords, display info, and user game statistics are all kept in the database and accessed by the users unique email ID. If a user already has an account, they sign in and are brought to the main game room. The game room includes the user’s character icon that can move around the game room by using arrow keys and walking up to the game tables. Once a user has approached a game table, they are brought to a page that allows them to play that game. User’s Blackjack statistics are kept in the database and are viewable to the user when they press the stats button. The user is free to switch between games in the game room, and sign out / sign in when they want to play again.

We made Retr.io Games using HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Heroku.
